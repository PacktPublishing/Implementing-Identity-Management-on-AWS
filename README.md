This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand AWS IAM concepts, terminology, and services
* Explore AWS IAM, Amazon Cognito, AWS SSO, and AWS Directory Service to solve customer and workforce identity problems
* Apply the concepts you learn about to solve business, process, and compliance challenges when expanding into AWS
* Navigate the AWS CLI to unlock the programmatic administration of AWS
* Explore how AWS IAM, its policy objects, and notational language can be applied to solve security and access management use cases
Relate concepts easily to your own environment through IAM patterns and best practices
